# GK1-PolygonEditor
This is a simple CAD-like app in WinForms which allows creating polygons, circles and adding contraints on edges/circles. It was a first project of GK1 course at MINI faculty at WUT.

## DISCLAIMER
This project's structure and quality of code is pretty bad (result of making some features work until 6am on deadline day). It may change in the future.
